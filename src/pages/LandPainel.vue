      This is a small social media dedicated to developers and aspiring
      developers who want to make friends, coding buddies, mentors or work
      together in projects.

      Specially when you're beginning in the world of coding, finding someone to
      share tips, work together or even to keep each other motivated is a hard
      mission. So, trying to facilitate this, I've created this simple web app
      that, hopefully, can help you out.
